## About me

Welcome to my website! My name is Renata and I am a PhD candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am part of the [Derryberry lab](https://derryberrylab.wordpress.com/), where I study the evolution of bird communication in female antbirds.

During my free time, I [crochet birds](https://www.instagram.com/renatabeco/), go for hikes where I bird and post all cool organisms I found on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/renatabeco).
