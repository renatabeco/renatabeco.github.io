## About me

![](IMG_9923.jpg){fig-align="left" width="272"}

Welcome to my website! My name is Renata and I am a PhD candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am part of the Derryberry lab, where I study the evolution of bird communication in female antbirds.

During my free time, I crochet birds, go for hikes where I bird and post all cool organisms I found on my iNaturalist.
